345,risin_developer,That's what a #deepneuralnet looks like #MachineLearning #ArtificialIntelligence #BigData https://t.co/366CYqX6Or
346,risin_developer,hmmmm 😗😗 https://t.co/W8wveCtkaU
347,risin_developer,so I joined @kaggle today...went through their #ML courses. Its just great.
348,risin_developer,Some nice #visualization of different #ML algorithms doing #classification on three #datasets https://t.co/IF7blNFfQg
349,risin_developer,This is just amazing .. https://t.co/vGob7MJZe8
350,risin_developer,I just published “Writing your first Python Code: INSTALLATION &amp; SET-UP” on medium. Go check it out.  https://t.co/w8QVdG7Bh6
351,risin_developer,"An expert in any field.  You're invited to give a lecture. Just so you know, the blah blah blah you ignore in your lecture is the most important message you should  to elaborate on. ""You're not talking to experts remember!"""
352,risin_developer,Being bored is an insult to your #Intelligence
353,risin_developer,Program doesn't run at first...So I'll just re-compile.... And it now works. ....That's why #programming is magic my friend

358,risin_developer,If you know the things a developer in Nigeria can achieve with constant Electricity and Good Network.The Silicon Valley guys would find us. 😋
359,risin_developer,"Artificial Intelligence is the new Electricity.
Big Data is the new Gold.
Computer Science is the new Medicine
Get in the spirit, something big is coming...🙅‍♂️"
360,risin_developer,lol....This is triumph in the face of adversity https://t.co/Tlj6JDlMvQ
361,risin_developer,#Bigdata is the new Gold
362,risin_developer,"No matter what kinda developer or technology you use, #AI has a big part of it. So it would be better to learn the tool for the trade now...Get in #ArtificialIntelligence today. Have a great week Fam"
363,risin_developer,been hearing @AndrewYNg voice these past few weeks when I sleep. I think I'm ready. #MachineLearning #DeepLearning #AndrewNgDeepLearningCourse
364,risin_developer,This should be a priority one course in all schools https://t.co/SSnuFXZCPT
365,risin_developer,Giant strides to the AI community..🙂 https://t.co/ZB0PROBqaJ
366,risin_developer,"I believe strong A.I will be possible in the nearest future, we just have to crack the machine self consciousness barrier."
