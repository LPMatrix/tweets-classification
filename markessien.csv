0,markessien,Internship opportunity in data science https://t.co/z0ZxdIdchC
1,markessien,Register for HNG Internship 5.0: https://t.co/qdA52GMXpn
2,markessien,Tongo usen ikut oduo ito ikpaha ufik efit.
3,markessien,"In Cinemas from december 28th, actually! https://t.co/8Zko93rcnJ"
4,markessien,"Up North, the movie by @EditiEffiong, is premiering Dec 26th. Make sure you see it this year! https://t.co/MQ1wYdgzoH"
5,markessien,"Tommorow is Startup Friday featuring me, among others. Enjoying my Abuja time, very different vibe from Lagos. https://t.co/gPvULQxgwv"
6,markessien,In Abuja for @ngrinnovation #startupfriday
7,markessien,"We have more doubt about what works than what does not work. E.g, 'I went on this boat and it sank' is not weighed the same as 'I went on this boat and it did not sink'. Hence, experienced people avoid a lot of what did not work, while doubting what did work."
8,markessien,What are the things you would want a president of Nigeria to do in 2019 for tech startups and software developers?
9,markessien,I have about 15 items left in my Todo list. Any new item from now on is going into the 2019 folder.
10,markessien,"I don't think it matters much if a person is late for a job interview. It is very rare that someone actually choses to be late, mostly it is something beyond their control. So judging them on that is very flawed and bad interviewing."
11,markessien,A thread of some gadgets I use (in case you are looking to buy gadgets as xmas present for someone this year): 1. The Devolo dlan for getting internet around your house without using Wifi. Uses your electrical circuits in the house to transmit electricity. https://t.co/o7KsYj2Lj8
12,markessien,"Happy to announce, that after close to 6 months of struggle, the desktop PC I built is no longer electrically shocking people who press the left shift key."
13,markessien,"Solar and connected homes have the same problem - they require home modifications, which are hard and expensive, even if you call in an external party."
14,markessien,Data science folk see here https://t.co/KZQtJ8ZCBB
15,markessien,"If you want to know how bitcoin price will move, you can use this chart: https://t.co/TrQylhUdmx. The more dominant bitcoin is, the more the price goes down. If the trend is towards bitcoin dominance, then the price trend will remain downwards."
16,markessien,"It's very easy to forget that someone did a favour for you, but the person remembers and is upset that you never acknowledged it. If you did me a favour and I have forgotten, I beg your forgiveness. And please, do remind me of it, I am not ungrateful, just may have lost track"
17,markessien,Nigerians only: how do you transfer money to people?
18,markessien,"If you are sick of Nigerian politics as usual, with the same old politicians, instead of doing nothing - just vote @obyezeks and @acpnhope. Your one vote is the way you can protest and say that you are tired."
19,markessien,"If you are a graphic designer or into video production, you can also volunteer for the @obyezeks campaign...equipment is available https://t.co/OyNfr1QTXx"
20,markessien,Cameroonian president Paul Biya and his wife are such regulars at Geneva‚Äôs Intercontinental Hotel they have code names: Him and Her https://t.co/xEiD1t6rb9 via @WSJ
21,markessien,"If you are a software developer/designed willing to volunteer to work on a platform to support @obyezeks political campaign, dm, tweet or email me"
22,markessien,"I'm a big advocate of Nigerian developers moving abroad. Because there is no shortage of local developers. There is only a shortage if you are unwilling to invest in their training, but you want them to come work when they are trained - and at below global market prices."
23,markessien,What could you spend an entire day watching documentaries about? That's something you could make into your passion
24,markessien,"It is wrong to assume that incumbents do not realise that their industry is changing around them. They do, but they are often filled with blocking decision makers who do not understand what needs to be done, and so block the necessary things from happening."
25,markessien,Tweet a screenshot of your current internet speed using https://t.co/WJCu94ni4E
26,markessien,A good way to destroy societal productivity is to hire the best people into roles where they are better paid to be far less productive.
27,markessien,Very smart thread ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/8HQiIsROFF
28,markessien,Calling all prophets on twitter: Can you accurately prophesy an event that will happen in the future as a reply to this thread? Please specify the date. We will come back to check on that date.
29,markessien,"I think it is essential (and not optional in any way) that all the women and children 'rescued' from Boko Haram are interviewed publicly, so we know what really happened. Because there is every chance that it was mistaken identity, and the men killed were not terrorists at all."
30,markessien,Ezekwesili: I will disrupt Nigeria's politics of failure @CNNI https://t.co/3RR2kQJuuf
31,markessien,"If these were the only candidates in the country, who would you vote for as president?"
32,markessien,"In terms of tech clusters, I see Enugu and Uyo as the real next contenders after Lagos. Those two seem to be holding the slow steady fire that lasts, while other places seem very on and off."
33,markessien,"Africa as a single entity is equivalent to India in terms of market. The problem is in our thinking - we don't see ourselves as Africans, but as Nigerians. That's like someone in India building a product just for Delhi."
34,markessien,Would you buy this power bank at N50k? If it could keep your laptop charged for two days? (Reason is that we are looking for a powerbank for our remote interns). https://t.co/NvIos6aPaN
35,markessien,"Let me re-iterate what I believe the right approach to building the tech of a country : 1. Building technical talent 2. Connecting the best with each other to collaborate on projects 3. Many small online projects develop 4. Out of those, bigger startups develop."
36,markessien,Next HNG internship will be in python. Good idea or bad?
37,markessien,Check out this tool by @theshalvah -  @this_vid It allows you to download any video from twitter by just asking it to download for you
38,markessien,"The reason China is the manufacturing capital of the world is that they forced their currency to remain *weak* for so long, not *strong*. They created a locked-in, separate world where things were 'normal' priced internally, but cheap priced outside."
39,markessien,"Perfect information transfer between separate AI agents would be a mistake. It does not occur in nature, first of all. But primarily, it removes the possibility of mistakes, which makes the agents learn too uniformly. Different learnings will advance the entire group better."
40,markessien,Uninspired personalisation in marketing campaigns is a brand-agnostic way of building product awareness - while avoiding the performance marketing trap. https://t.co/ajHyQioEB3
41,markessien,https://t.co/Jfdbn0ook6
42,markessien,Which of these is the biggest problem in Nigeria?
43,markessien,"The people in army bands, do they join the army to be in the band, or do they join as soldiers and then someday someone assigns them to be in the band?"
44,markessien,"In the future, Chinese factories, as soon as their product is ready, will put it on some website. This site will push this product to tens of thousands of global websites, who process local payments. One an order comes in, some logistic chain will pick it and move to consumer."
45,markessien,It's not enough to create developers. We have to create jobs for early-stage developers. Those not good enough to work production code. So they can practise in a controlled environment. Otherwise many lose interest and get frustrated.
46,markessien,"If you are intolerant of intolerance, are you intolerant?"
47,markessien,Do you support a flat tax? I.e everyone pays a flat 15% tax on their income?
48,markessien,"Okadabooks seems to be the default publishing platform for Nigerian authors. If I were and investor, I would look at them."
49,markessien,Back in Lagos. First time I am happy to be back here.
50,markessien,Who is interested in buying an island and setting up a new country there?
51,markessien,"It is irresponsible not to split a company into independent units financially. If one area is going to make money 'in future', it should borrow its startup capital from part of company making money, and return it when it works. Otherwise, money losing 'ideas' can persist too long"
52,markessien,I'm a bit confused about these Kupe Boys: what is their primary talent? Are they singers or dancers or what?
53,markessien,"Would you pay 10k a month to have a permanent 200Ah inverter battery in your home/office? If it dies, it is replaced with another one?"
54,markessien,"Do you consider Akwa Ibom to be a tribalistic place, or is it open to all tribes?"
55,markessien,"If the Ibom E-Library in Uyo offered you free working space for your startup (with internet and power), would you be willing to move your company to Uyo (assuming you do not come from there already)."
56,markessien,Two minutes before you receive a very important email that needs a lot of immediate action https://t.co/0v6DUoB8wF
57,markessien,My phone home screen https://t.co/paSQeMe6pl
58,markessien,Chat is a very powerful interface. But it's powerful when used for complex queries that a human should deal with. It's terrible when used for an interface where buttons work very well.
59,markessien,"The future of African e-commerce is direct China deliveries - via plane if needed quickly, otherwise ship."
60,markessien,üíØ https://t.co/0TIRWhWdz1
61,markessien,Banning motorbikes in cities lowers productivity. Motorbikes are extremely flexible ways to move people around.
62,markessien,"Ai as a platform will have to be distinct components that do distinct things. Just like the lung does lung work, you can have a 'black-boxed' walking AI. Or proximity detection. When those are working well, you can then combine them to a higher level AI."
63,markessien,Would you pay for a service that does freedom of information requests for you from government agencies?
64,markessien,"Trying to get everyone to agree to a decision will lead to everyone agreeing only on the most average thing, and the results will be average."
65,markessien,"The new lenders in Nigeria, e.g renmoney and so on, are an extremely critical part of the economy, no matter how high the rates they charge. They create short term liquidity where there was none, and this greases productivity."
66,markessien,"For businesses that can predict their future cashflow, it is far better to raise money using loans than using equity investments. But you must be able to predict really accurately and take loans you can repay with a lot of lee-way."
67,markessien,Who knows a bit about the Eligible Customer energy regulation 2017 and can teach me in the DMs?
68,markessien,How do we pass a law in Nigeria requiring all federal and state governments to publish ever single Kobo they spend online? Can we just submit it or does a senator have to do this? Who knows the process?
69,markessien,"Using a modified french gutter to try to step erosion on this road. Roofing sheets on the bottom, stones in the sheets and sandbags to border it. This creates a channel for water to run along. The road seems to be holding so far. If it works, will extend for entire road. https://t.co/odeyS9N6Hj"
70,markessien,"For those thinking I may ever want to go into politics - wrong! I don't have the patience to be dealing with politicians. One can create a lot of change via business, without needing to get dirty in politics."
71,markessien,"Someone told me that the BMW X6, if it receives dirty petrol, will prefer to knock its engine than produce dirty emissions. Is this true?"
72,markessien,"Will Nigeria really be a better place if you install Atiku, Fayose, Ben Bruce, Saraki, Wike, Reno as the people running the country?"
73,markessien,"You think business will be better under Atiku? Atiku has been controlling Onne port, Calabar, Warri port through his company Intels. Have his actions there made business better for the avg Aba trader? Why do traders clear their goods in Lagos till today? Don't let them use you."
74,markessien,"For every 10 people who believe in the vision, there is one person who believes in the vision and is willing to act to support the vision. And of those willing to act, some are competent and some are not. Those willing to act, and who are competent are the ones who create change."
75,markessien,"In 2017, the federal government attempted to reduce the price of the eastern ports (Warri, Onne, Calabar) to encourage more traffic there. INTELS, which manages the ports, and is owned by Atiku, took the govt to court that those ports should remain more expensive than Lagos."
76,markessien,Anyone in the lending business has to realise that determining credit worthiness should be a separate event from disbursing funds. If you do the credit worthiness determination at disbursal time (and it's cumbersome) many will abandon your credit. Loans have a time factor to them
77,markessien,"I think it's kind of silly that Americans assume that their primary stock market top 500 index fund will keep going up. Productivity has risen immensely in the last 100 years due to new tools, and it has driven overall growth but that will not be for infinity."
78,markessien,"So much talent in the small cities and towns of Nigeria. We have been successfully running our call centre in Akwa Ibom for almost a year now, and it's going really well. As you scale, don't be stuck in Lagos-only mindset."
79,markessien,Started writing my talk for devfest-south-south in Uyo.
80,markessien,"1/ Remember this: Atiku brought in Gen Yar'Adua as a shareholder in Intels. Those shares passed on to Umaru Yar'Adua, who Atiku ran against in a presidential election (two shareholders of INTELS running against each other). After Yar'Adua won in 2007..."
81,markessien,"Yar'Adua, his co-founder (in effect) in Intels? Who then proceeded to sign a multi-year concession over to his election opponent? Strengthens the conspiracy theory though. https://t.co/X8HpTEVwBa"
82,markessien,"Unskilled labour is very, very cheap in most of Africa. Any startup that competes against unskilled labour will struggle to find good margins."
83,markessien,"This difference in cost is a big part of how Lagos maintains its dominance, and how the Niger-Delta is disadvantaged. The costs for all ports needs to be equal to level the playing field. https://t.co/aso2urbrLy"
84,markessien,"I get less than 1 call a week on my GSM line. Get lots more WhatsApp calls, twitter DM and whatsapp messages, and even more emails. I could stay without an active phone line for weeks and I doubt many would notice. We are entering the Post-GSM era."
85,markessien,Can someone explain this though? Why are the Niger-Delta ports so expensive compared to Lagos port? Atiku has been in charge of these ports for a while - why does he charge so much that the ports are not viable? https://t.co/2C3rjZavEh
86,markessien,Atiku keeps running against incumbent presidents and keeps losing. And all those presidents maintain his companies as the ones running the countries sea ports. Have you considered that maybe he runs to lose? To make sure there is no actual opposition?
87,markessien,How much does it cost to clear a container in Port Harcourt vs in Lagos port?
88,markessien,One of the most awesome things I tried this year was 2 weeks of water-only as recommended by @EditiEffiong
89,markessien,"There is only one way for a startup to grow at the speed VCs want - and that is for it to achieve exponential growth and not linear growth. To achieve exponential growth, there has to be an underlying exponential formula running inside the startup, and this creates the growth."
90,markessien,"I wake up alarmingly early. 4am, 5am. How do I fix this? I want to be waking by 7am."
91,markessien,"As a software developer, learning docker is no longer optional. Nowadays, its like saying you don't want to learn git. And if you do not know what any of those two are, please join the HNG internship, starting February 2019."
92,markessien,"There should be something like a friends and family business lending tool. Where a business can raise N5m loan at 30% interest for example, and ask their family/friends to use the platform to invest and track their returns."
93,markessien,"If you spend more than $100 monthly on your mailing list tool, try switching to Amazon SES with Sendy. If that also grows such that it exceeds $250/month, its worth setting up mailcow with nextcloud/rainloop. Just use a strict host to avoid being flagged on your email."
94,markessien,"To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion"
95,markessien,"My favourite begging method is the little boy who stands on side of road crying. If you ask what's wrong, he will say that he was sent to buy something, he lost the money and his parents will beat him when he gets home. So you give him money. Next day, he's there crying again."
96,markessien,Amazing. https://t.co/MhwbchwLyG
97,markessien,"https://t.co/f8xVHQqGZs is looking for female coding interns. Backend development only. Lagos, on-site only. Please send repo link to friday@hotelsng.email."
98,markessien,"For things used very often by a lot of people (like payments or chat), even half a second of use-speed improvements has a massive productivity impact, and will get that thing adopted very quickly."
99,markessien,One of the major topics of the Nigerian election is that a bunch of people seriously believe that our real president secretly died and was replaced by a clone called Jubril from Sudan.
100,markessien,"Maybe what drove human intelligence was a bug where, instead of learning just enough to fit in its environment, the learning never stopped. And out of that, emergent behaviour developed."
101,markessien,Just because I have some opinions you like does not mean you will like all my opinions. It's okay to dislike some opinions of mine and like some opinions. Keep the ones that make sense to you and ignore the rest.
102,markessien,The best way of creating fake news is to convince everyone that you are too credible to ever create fake news.
103,markessien,"1/ So many Christians have lost their way and they do not realise it. The root of all this starts from literal, non-questioning acceptance of the Bible. The Bible is a human written narration of events, many books written hundreds of years after said events happened."
104,markessien,"If people knew the plights of others, they could choose to help. Making videos of people who need help would help get money and assistance to those people. Charities do not need to be monolithic, centrally controlled entities. Marketplace charities should happen."
105,markessien,"Another use-case - for dubbed movies, making the mouths of the people move like the words the translators are saying. https://t.co/okVprGAunN"
106,markessien,"It should be very possible for AI to create a perfect instrumental for any song, even if the vocals are there."
107,markessien,"This is a hotel booking site. This is a travel site. This is an experience marketplace. These are 3 different levels of abstraction, and each one adds brand complexity. Brand is human memory. Human memory works best with simple relationships and fails as abstraction/complexity gr"
108,markessien,"Fill some potholes on your road. The next time government brings you a bill, also issue them a bill for the potholes you fixed."
109,markessien,"When any kind of fundamental invention is found (e.g electricity), there are lots and lots of low hanging fruit to be built on top of it. Those things are so valuable that even with minimal skill, very large companies can develop on top of it. Over time, however..."
110,markessien,"Nigerians are actually richer per capita than the statistics show. This is because our population figures are quite inflated, and also because a lot of trade and GDP are just not captured in statistics (including international crime, which is quite a contributor)"
111,markessien,"Having used solar at our two offices and at home, I can conclusively say that even for someone technical like myself, solar needs more maintainance than a generator."
112,markessien,This week is devfest south-south in Uyo.
113,markessien,Uyo to Ikot Ekpene road is almost complete.
114,markessien,Are you currently a paid employee of Atiku?
115,markessien,"El Rufai was detained for two days by SSS in Anambra, and Peter Obi, Anambra Governor, shrugged and said: Why did he leave Katsina to come here? That was very wrong of him."
116,markessien,Re-Anambra: The Limits of Propaganda ~ Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai https://t.co/3uJT2FiR8i via @omojuwa
117,markessien,The largest reason for the high rate of education in the south of Nigeria where the Catholic missionaries.
118,markessien,"The real minimum wage of any area is the mid-point of the price a labourer will take for 6 hours of labour, and that a cleaner will take for 4 hours of cleaning."
119,markessien,"There is still a missing algorithm in AI. Something that parallels the 'intuition' of humans. It's some kind of elimination, best guess algorithm that uses past patterns and minimal current info to offer fast answers."
120,markessien,"What if consciousness is not a consequence of the arrangement of neurons and electrical signals? You know how you assume something is causing a bug, then you fix it, and the problem is not solved? What if we do 'maximum' AI, and still no consciousness develops? What's next?"
121,markessien,"If you had N100m in your account, would you buy a table you absolutely loved for N1m?"
122,markessien,"Human thinking must be digital in some way, and not continuous. There will be some latency in the electric impulses going from neuron to neuron. So there must be these little gaps in our perception of the world. Maybe that's where the ghosts are hiding."
123,markessien,Absolutely! https://t.co/vE4lLSkuFf
124,markessien,Finally switched to Airtel from 9mobile. Asked it my data balance. It is telling me a very long story I don't understand. So how much data do I actually have? https://t.co/rE76WDXZCS
125,markessien,"If a hive of ants could be seen as one animal, the all earth life forms could also be seen as one animal (as we are co-dependent). And looking at it the opposite way, a single animal could be seen as several co-dependent organisms. A liver creature, a lung creature, etc."
126,markessien,I have never seen a situation where an expert in one programming language was significantly less productive than an expert in another programming language.
127,markessien,One of the first skills you should learn in the African startup scene is to detect if an investor has money at all.
128,markessien,"Both of them. Split the money in two. Support two local startups, not one. https://t.co/RkWgNapMNb"
129,markessien,"Every asset you have has a 'performance' attribute that naturally degrades over time, unless work is done to keep it performing."
130,markessien,The single best interview question in Nigeria is: 'What is the moon?'. The depth of the reply will tell you a lot.
131,markessien,"People have a finely tuned instinct for 'fake' people. As a politician, don't be fake. I.e saying things on video that you do not mean. Unless you are a brilliant actor, people will see through it. And they won't trust you. Realness is getting more and more important."
132,markessien,My favourite African political song of 2018. Also a good chance to practise your Sierra Leonian pidgin https://t.co/4MpMDBps0M
133,markessien,"The first few social networks grew by massively spamming your contact list. In the meantime Gmail became biggest email service and restricted this massively, making it really hard for any new social network to take off."
134,markessien,"If you were forced to leave Lagos, and never ever come back, what would you miss about it?"
135,markessien,Is there any way to make the HNG Internship sustainable (i.e earn enough to cover its own costs) without affecting the core experience?
136,markessien,"Politics is a network-effect system with two dominant players only. Those two take 90%+ of the marketshare. The bandwagon effect seems to be driven by coverage - which inflames passions and drives more people into one court or the other, at expense of all alternatives."
137,markessien,"Off-grid Energy is not solved. The cost of solar/storage is half the problem, the other half of the problem is about how you use the electricity. That second half is ignored - the assumption is that consumers will do it right. They won't. They don't even understand it."
138,markessien,"9mobile tries to increase revenue per user by tricking the user into subscribing for a plan they don't want. These types of tactics are only good for short term revenue boosts, in the long term, they always lead to lower revenue."
139,markessien,"If you achieve any form of enlightenment, you cannot explain to someone else. You can say the words, but the people who have not gone through the same process to get there only see the surface."
140,markessien,Having two parties fighting for control of Akwa Ibom is very nice - roads being built everywhere. Went to our customer support office and found out NDDC had tarred the road. Welcome surprise
141,markessien,"I posit that the ratio of ladies who drive/ride motorized vehicles (cars, bikes, etc) on their own is a good measure of the patriarchy in that society"
142,markessien,"In times of extreme starvation (e.g no food or no rain), it makes sense for human populations to sacrifice people to the 'gods', in order to bring back those things. It makes sense because it reduces the number of people, which allows the others survive longer."
143,markessien,A child slave being kept in Nigeria. The people keeping her should spend years in prison. Children should never be treated this way. https://t.co/IcPp6OA10X
144,markessien,Google could probably triple it's revenue without any increase in traffic within a year if it really wanted to. Considering how high its revenue already is....
145,markessien,https://t.co/f8xVHQqGZs being presented to the president. @Suzy_smallz pitching. https://t.co/TBC1kYZLFW
146,markessien,"I don't believe that physicists are right with their current models of sub-atomic structures. As a programmer, it feels like there has to be less complexity, it should be one simple recursive function that has a complex output - like crystals."
147,markessien,"If you are looking to keep yourself busy during the ASUU strike, join this Slack Channel: https://t.co/4hppaK9Je1 There will be work for writers, coders and data entry people."
148,markessien,"If you are a coder affected by ASUU strike, tweet me a project you have online. You can stay busy in this period by interning with @hotelsng. Backend, Frontend, Design and Android tasks available."
149,markessien,"There is cool uncool (e.g coder nerds now) and uncool uncool (e.g crypto fanatics).  We tend to project from the later success of uncool, uncool people and portray them as cool uncool in their own time. But they probably were not."
150,markessien,"If you push people too little, they don't grow. If you push too hard, they break. You have to find the edge of their abilities. And then turn around and do this for yourself."
151,markessien,"HNG Internship 5.0 date is now confirmed. We start Feb 1, 2019."
152,markessien,"To be tested: Any product often used by the average person, and that has a bad UI will be disrupted by one with better design. All other products can only be disrupted by a company with a better sales/marketing process than the incumbent."
153,markessien,Bought some more trees https://t.co/rKWVv0LzQS
154,markessien,"All these little animals that humans are irrationally afraid of must have been so big threats to us along our evolutionary pathway that we decided to keep the memory around, just in case. E.g spiders, roaches, rats, snake, praying mantis"
155,markessien,"I really want to get into machine learning, but I cannot think of any problem to work on that needs machine learning."
156,markessien,Amazing! https://t.co/eXABW0v9dz
157,markessien,"The overall global political trend is getting clearer - more radical, and anti-establishment candidates are winning. Merging into the established political structure is a sure way to ensure your irrelevance. Information is no longer monopolised by single, state owned media."
158,markessien,"Everything you read or absorb becomes your short term point of view, if you are not actively aware that you have to fight that. The things you read 2 years ago are as valuable as what you read yesterday, but yesterday's read influences today more."
159,markessien,"You cannot fix the entire world. Pick the part of the world that is yours to fix, and obsessively focus on that part. Let the rest go."
160,markessien,The world changes. A dream you had 10 years ago may have been overtaken by the world - there is nothing wrong with giving it up and focusing on something more feasible for the world of today.
161,markessien,"If you daydream too much about what you would do 'if I were x', it can distract you from what you need to to today to ever become x."
162,markessien,"When two communities fight and people get killed, the anger remains. You can stop reprisal with force, but this is short term. For the long term, you need separation, reconciliation and compensation."
163,markessien,So many developers just for one website? I'm sure I could make that website in just 3 weeks. https://t.co/purQiKZkCB
164,markessien,"Influence is best measured in second-level influencing - not how well are you convincing people about your ideas, but how well are people convinced about your ideas convincing others."
165,markessien,We really need to take a moment to appreciate how well the Kaduna crisis is being handled. It could have been way worse without decisive action by the Governor.
166,markessien,I really like the @UNIONBANK_NG rebrand. Will open accounts with them.

335,markessien,Every emerging economy should have a national twitter-like Platform and an educational platform that every Telco has to make available for free to everyone (like Facebook free basics). Communication and education are two primary drivers of growth.
336,markessien,"One of the most interesting things happening nowadays are the algorithmic, taste specific movies being produced by Netflix. IMDb and RT ratings have always been flawed - either they avg out or they represent 'elite' avg opinions. Low rated movies are loved by a small group."
337,markessien,"If you participated in the @hnginternship and there was something you did NOT like about it, DM me (DM is open). I want us to make it better for the next time."
338,markessien,"Some people learn better watching videos, some learn better with text. Nothing wrong with either, just two different ways. What video misses is an easy way to jump to chapters/topics. Someone should invent that."

350,markessien,First set of studio equipment https://t.co/IccmCpIifO
351,markessien,Nigeria barely has power. Solar panels are widely available in Nigeria. So are batteries. Nigeria is a relatively sunny country. So why is solar power not used everywhere and has remained a niche product?
352,markessien,"Starting the planning for the next HNG Internship, which will happen early 2019. Thinking of focusing on machine learning this time,"
353,markessien,It is a hard fact that there is a certain configuration of communication nodes that results in consciousness. It also seems true that a key component of this lies in abstraction of layers.
354,markessien,AI 1: Clean up Stack Overflow responses to standardize them. AI 2: Use those responses to solve programming problems to achieve some stated coding goal.

356,markessien,"Give the choice, who would you rather vote as president: @segalink or @DrJoeAbah?"
357,markessien,There is a business to be made in offering common web services to countries under U.S sanctions. Many U.S companies do not allow them sign up - so you can easily target them with your alternative offer.
358,markessien,"What can private companies do in order to make sure that in 5 years, Nigeria has 100,000 highly skilled and employed coders?"
359,markessien,"One very interesting use-case for crypto is to act as a universal login mechanism. If something like meta-mask were part of all browsers, you can basically have an account to store bookmarks, cookies, etc - and also to store money."
360,markessien,"If you were forced to follow only one person on twitter (excluding family and people you know personally), who would that person be?"
361,markessien,"A test to know if to take money from an investor is this - ask the founders of the companies they have backed: ""In your next venture, would you take money from this investor, if you had a competing, similar offer from an investor you have never worked with before?"""
362,markessien,"You interview designers with their portfolio, writers with their writing, so if you want to interview a coder, you look at their past projects. But if you are not a coder, you know you cannot evaluate properly. So how is it different for writers and designers? Tip: it isn't."
363,markessien,Computer Village have a WhatsApp group where vendors ask themselves if they have parts for particular laptops they are trying to repair. Sounds like it would be a great use-case for a chatbot. Register your inventory via chat and request other people's inventory.
364,markessien,Two great movies to watch: UFO (2018) and Searching (2018)

372,markessien,You can name any internal product any weird name you choose and soon it becomes part of the internal vocabulary of the company without anyone thinking anymore of how ridiculous it sounds.
373,markessien,Why don't you bank with FCMB?
374,markessien,"Do you currently bank using FCMB? Would you recommend it or not? What is good or bad about it? If you don't use it, what is your impression of it?"
375,markessien,I will not vote for any Nigerian candidate who does not promise to make all government expenses fully public. It's the true test of integrity. https://t.co/KhCXOYHhFD
376,markessien,"The financial relationship between a govt and its citizens is simple - we pay you tax, you tell us what you do with our tax money, and use it wisely, and we are both happy."
377,markessien,"Any capital city without a lot of high-rises in the CBD (barring regulation banning it), is a good city to buy land close to the CBD in. It means the land is still relatively cheap."
378,markessien,"It's very, very simple to do almost everything, except you don't know how to, in which case it's very, very difficult."
379,markessien,"If your startup has more than 1000 customers that would be very unhappy if you shut down, and you fear you are about to shut down, email me: mark@hotels.ng. We are looking to buy small startups."
380,markessien,"Nigeria sold 3G licenses for $150m. The companies who bought those licenses have made $billions in profit.  Nigeria should go radical - let everyone get 3g licenses for $10k and just tax each call with a special, small tax. Huge revenue potential, lots of business/jobs created."
381,markessien,"Of every 100 people with a phone that can make voice calls in Nigeria, at least 60 of them own a phone that can access 2g or 3g. That's what the NCC data shows."
382,markessien,Irritating people with notifications drives growth to the top of a local maxima
383,markessien,"Nigeria should introduce 'national names'. So if you choose to be a Nigerian without a tribe, you adopt a 'national' surname that makes it impossible to identify what tribe you come from using your name."
384,markessien,"Tell me some wealthy clusters in Nigeria: E.g Lekki, Shelter Afrique, Port Harcourt GRA, State Housing Calabar...? Any more examples?"
385,markessien,"The natural path of evolution is not towards more intelligence, it is towards more domain specific knowledge, which in many ways is 'dumbness'. A dove needs to only be as intelligent as its environment requires it to be."
386,markessien,"Do you have a startup with revenues in the range of 500k/month to N1m/month? If you do and are interested in selling it, email me at mark@hotels.ng. (Note that revenue in this context is not sales-volume, but what you earn before paying salaries, rent, etc.)"

390,markessien,"If you registered a Limited company in Nigeria, you need to file FIRS tax monthly, even if you don't earn income (otherwise &gt; 100k Penalty/year). My friend Seun is offering a service to file on your behalf monthly at N2,500 per filing. Email him: oluseunakinboni@gmail.com"

396,markessien,"If you want to stop govt corruption, there is no need to be running up and down and doing gymnastics. Just upload all detailed govt expenses to the internet and make them public. All contracting companies and their directors/staff too. Problem easily solved."

398,markessien,"If you are a startup that needs promotion and marketing, let's partner. We'll promote you to hundreds of thousands of HNG customers, in return you promote us too. If interested in partnering, email: startup-partnerships@hotels.ng"
399,markessien,"Absolutely. And when they try to break out of it, they still end up making the mistake. E.g for diversity they say they want to hire people from low-income backgrounds. And they search for people from low-income that talk and act the most like them. Same same. https://t.co/805ysSJvHA"
400,markessien,There are some people who will never get accepted to elite schools or pass human interviews because they don't fit the pattern. The problem is worse when there is a lot of income inequality - and interviewers are high income.

403,markessien,"Whoever wins the Nigeria election is who the people want. But the election must be fair. People with bags of voters cards must not be allowed to vote. Vote buying must not happen. Let real elections happen, that's the most important thing."
404,markessien,"In Ekiti State in 2015, 160k people had full biometric accreditation. All accredited were 325k people. 300k people voted. But in the 2018 Governorship election 384k people ended up voting. The votes exceed what statistically we expect based on number of active phone lines."
405,markessien,Bear in mind that @inecnigeria has not yet released information on accreditation method on all governorship elections after the 2015 election. This information is critical for us to know how many real people voted. https://t.co/n1d7OTjM7r
406,markessien,"A very simple statistical way to show that at least 5 million votes in the 2015 election were fake: 4,944,085 votes were recorded without *any* accreditation (card or biometric). The voter ages 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 55 had 4,942,893 votes more than statistically expected."
407,markessien,"What I like about consumer internet is that if one person misunderstands, there are a million who will understand. In sales, however, that one person can stop the million people from ever getting to know you."
408,markessien,"When National Population Commission boss faulted the census of Nigeria, Mr. @RMKwankwaso called for his sack, saying he was a drunkard. Jonathan proceeded to sack him, probably in the interest of national peace: https://t.co/gnUMdBZ6vQ"
409,markessien,"I doubt Nigeria has more than 120 million people. Also, it is clear that many states have grossly inflated population numbers. There is neither satellite evidence nor phone-usage evidence to indicate the population figures of Katsina, Kano and other nearby states."
410,markessien,"In Lebanon, people have big generators and sell to their neighbourhoods. Why does nobody do this in Nigeria? Why does everyone own their own generator?"
411,markessien,"If you do not restart your dreamliner airplane every 248 days, it will lose all power due to a software bug 
https://t.co/1U5Nlob6FQ"
412,markessien,"Has @inecnigeria published statistics on how many votes in Edo, Ekiti, Anambra, Ondo, Kogi, Bayelsa elections were biometrically accredited vs card-only accredited? Is it not important that we know this?"
413,markessien,Here is a document showing the measured population of Nigeria for each city based on satellite data by the EU. Are any cities or towns missing? https://t.co/Zt0Dr9yPnf
414,markessien,Speak to @PatrickUdohEsq https://t.co/mlpYLBy2oq
415,markessien,"Right now, there are politicians in Nigeria who have sacks of PVCs sitting in their compounds that they want to use to vote in the 2019 election. The INEC data tells us which states those are. Every citizen must make sure that they do not allow this happen. It's your future."
416,markessien,"Has @inecnigeria announced the full biometric vs card-only accreditation for all elections conducted after 2015? If not, does anyone want to help place a freedom of information request with them to make them provide the info?"
417,markessien,It is obvious that some people are holding on to the PVCs of people in all the states below. For the 2019 election to be credible @inecnigeria must acknowledge the implausibly high PVC collection rate and tell us the steps it is taking to control this. https://t.co/F9rsHOQEtz
418,markessien,"It is great that @inecnigeria has banned incident forms, which will prevent the fraud like below from happening. But it also needs to ensure that it rejects all elections where full biometric authentication could not be conducted at a rate below card-only authentication. https://t.co/reRd7nmj4q"
419,markessien,"It is essential that @inecnigeria announced the full biometric authentication rate for all elections, including those done so far, as well as the 2019 election. https://t.co/wuFbtMJ4qK"
420,markessien,This is the most correct tweet I have read all year https://t.co/zhsMocLlt3
421,markessien,The future trends towards what is better. Is it better that cars run of electricty or oil? Is it better that Silicon Valley remains the innovation center of the world or not? It takes some kind of monopoly force to keep things in a way that is worse long term.
422,markessien,"This chart shows the number of active phone connections vs the number of voters in the 2015 election. Clearly, the numbers do not match up. In 2019, if the numbers do not line up, the election should be repeated. Data source here: https://t.co/2I2InKpyw2 https://t.co/4JKrXAt9M2"
423,markessien,"Has INEC released the info on if Card-Only or Full-Biometric accreditation was done in Anambra, Ekiti elections?"
424,markessien,"Card-Only accreditation is the next big loophole in INECs election. Kano, Katsina, Kaduna, Jigawa, Bauchi, Sokoto, Zamfara, Kebbi alone had 3.5m people who voted without doing biometric accreditation. Why was biometric accreditation so low in those states?"
425,markessien,"Of these, up to 4m of them were in states that PDP/Jonathan won. https://t.co/oCcT9RIP8g"
426,markessien,"It's very clear that 5 million fake votes were recorded in the 2015 election. Point one: 5m votes were recorded without accreditation Point 2: If you look at the statistical anomalies in peoples ages, then you have 5m too (i.e excess count people whose age was a round number)"
427,markessien,"In the 2015 election, over 5 million votes were recorded without any PVC and without any Biometric info. To protect democracy in Nigeria long-term, this must never be allowed to repeat itself. See dataset here: https://t.co/2I2InKpyw2"
428,markessien,"According to my data set, the Ekiti Election showed anomalies in the results: https://t.co/2I2InKpyw2 There were more voters than expected."
429,markessien,"From this dataset, can you figure out which states had fake votes in the 2015 election? https://t.co/2I2InKpyw2"
430,markessien,"Apart from Anambra elections, which other Nigeria Governor elections were held after the 2015 presidential elections?"
431,markessien,"We are working on preparing a video interview studio that anyone can use for free. Camera, sound, lights, power and stage will be available. Our conditions: you include our brand in the video, your show must have at least 6 episodes (not one-off). Interested? Email mark@hotels.ng"
432,markessien,"Protect your optimism, it's a candle that can very easily go out. https://t.co/ErmITIAUyf"
433,markessien,"The insidious form of cynicism is the intelligent one - the well sourced, well written articles about how things will not work, and how everyone is doing everything wrong, and how the crash is just around the corner. Building is necessarily optimism."
434,markessien,"If you are an idealistic dreamer, do all you can to avoid cynics. They will take away your idealism and all the 'what if'. A dreamer without dreams will not become 'normal', they will become empty."
435,markessien,"The northern Nigerian states of Kebbi, Niger, Borno, Katsina, Sokoto, Yobe, Zamfara, Nasarawa have their mobile phone penetration growing at 22% per quarter. That means that millions of people are just starting now to use a phone for the first time."
436,markessien,"If we gave you an interview studio to use for free, with camera, lights, sound and everything, would you use it? You can video shoot your own interviews with anyone you want. You have to edit by yourself and upload to your youtube."
437,markessien,"We have entered the age of so many geniuses, that nobody will be remembered as a genius"
438,markessien,Time to do that Ghost 2.0 upgrade
439,markessien,"The vast majority of human labour is spent doing monotonous, repetitive work that a machine could do. The people doing that work would prefer more creative work, but they need to eat. The robots will not take away jobs, they will free us up to do more interesting jobs."
440,markessien,"According to my data, the most valuable markets in Nigeria: 1. The Lagos, Ogun, Ibadan cluster. 2. The Kano-Kaduna-Abuja Corridor 3. Port-Harcourt-Aba Axis 4. Onitsha-Asaba urban area. Still crunching though."
441,markessien,Which of these two states do you think has a bigger population - Ogun or Oyo?
442,markessien,Would you be interested in an internship in marketing?
443,markessien,A lot of the major startups in Nigeria now have at least one or two of the HNG Interns working there.

446,markessien,"The worst states for internet businesses (i.e they have a low penetration but are declining) are: Akwa Ibom, Ebonyi and Benue"
447,markessien,The states with the highest internet penetration that are STILL growing fast in Nigeria are: 1. Ogun State 2. Ondo State 3. Oyo State 4. Plateau  5. Ekiti. These states represent the best place for internet based businesses looking for growing markets.
448,markessien,A simple way to show that a large number of votes in the 2015 election were fake - the number of people whose age was a round number is far greater than those whose age was a normal number. Compare number of people who are 30 to those who are 29 or 31. https://t.co/FZEyLl0kMX

451,markessien,Imagine you did a one-off big deal that netted you N350m (about $1m) and it's in your bank right now. There is very little chance of you doing a similar deal again in your life. What would you do with the money to allow it keep you comfortable for your whole life?

477,markessien,"You can't really learn to be a good manager with books. To manage, you can know all the theory, but you also need to know how people will react to the things you do and the way you are - in an infinite number of diffierent situations. And you need to act in a way for good outcome"

481,markessien,That's the idea. The activists need to mobilize hundreds of thousands of people to all vote within a single week. That will only work if the elected person is deeply unpopular.

484,markessien,"An idea to deepen democracy: election body runs an always-on online voting portal. If in any week, 75% of people who voted for a particular governor or president vote for their recall, it automatically triggers a new general election for that seat."
485,markessien,"I feel the reason there are less Nigerian startups now is that the new successful startups don't want to make much noise anymore (unlike PR blitzes of few years ago). So the new techies are not bothering with startups anymore, but focusing on doing remote work or applying abroad."
